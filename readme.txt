WP Accessibility fixes common accessibility issues in your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plug-in helps with a variety of common accessibility problems in WordPress themes. While most accessibility issues can't be addressed without directly changing your theme, WP Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with a minimum amount of setup or expert knowledge.

All features can be disabled according to your theme's needs. For advanced users, all of the functions based on modifying stylesheets can be customized using your own custom styles by placing the appropriate stylesheet in your theme directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= WP Accessibility is inserting some information via javascript. Is this really accessible? =

Yes. It does require that the user is operating a device that has javascript support, but that encompasses the vast majority of devices and browsers today, including screen readers.

= I installed WP Accessibility and ran some tests, but I'm still getting errors WP Accessibility is supposed to correct. =

Even if WP Accessibility is running correctly, not all accessibility testing tools will be aware of the fixes. Here's a resource for more information: [Mother Effing Tool Confuser](http://mothereffingtoolconfuser.com/).
